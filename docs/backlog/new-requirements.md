# New requirements

- **Foundation**: In the admin mode, make the userlist editable. The allowed users are stored in the database with their email address and a role (admin, user).  
- **Content**: On the starting page, instead of showing " bndstr - Official Band Hub. Music, Rehearsals, and Beer", only show the logo of the band. Also remove the "Next rehearsal" button and "Song Voting" button. It shall remain in the main navigation menu on top.
- **Voting**: Remove the spotify and youtube preview embedding. Instead, only get the album thumbnail from the song and link the song to spotify and youtube. The thumbnail should be clickable and open the song in the respective application.
- **Setlist**: Remove the spotify and youtube preview embedding. Instead, only get the album thumbnail from the song and link the song to spotify and youtube. The thumbnail should be clickable and open the song in the respective application.
- **New Feature**: "bend a stand" in a new tab. Shows a SVG of a music stand. When clicking on it and pulling it, the stand will bend at the position selected. The longer you bend it, the more "Strength points" you get. Resets after each load of the page.
- **Admin**: Add an import/export for calendar entries (CSV).
- **i18n**: Add multi-language support for English and German with browser default.
- **UI**: Theme-aware logo switching (white/black logo).
